#Step 3: Style the Category Page

The CSS naming convention we use is a modified version of BEM. We call it "CSM" (Component, Sub-component, Modifier). For more information on CSM and on all of our CSS best practices, read the CSS section of our [Mobify code style project](https://github.com/mobify/mobify-code-style/tree/master/css).

To follow our best practices, we often add classes to the desktop HTML and we change the markup for elements. This step covers a few examples of our best practices. We also show you how to add the SCSS to style this page.

##Task A

### Update the Template HTML

There are a few different ways to affect HTML that the template outputs. The first way is to modify the template file iteself.

1. In Terminal, ensure that you are in the `workshop--adaptivejs-site` directory. On the command line, enter the `grunt preview` command to start the preview.
2. [Preview the Adaptive.js Site](https://cloud.mobify.com/docs/adaptivejs/getting-started/new-project/#/start-adaptivejs-server). Use the Merlin's Potions Potion page `http://www.merlinspotions.com/potions` URL for the Site URL form field.

    Refresh the page in your browser as you update the template HTML and SCSS to view the changes.

3. In an editor app, in the `adaptation/templates` folder, open the `category.dust` dust template file.
4. Wrap the `{title}` key in a `div` element with the `t-category__title` class.

    ![Wrap title in a div](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/15359/64553/AoTbBtkdqrBznRL/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-16%20at%201.25.40%20PM.png)

5. Save the `category.dust` file and close it.

Inspect the class name to understand how it follows our [class naming convention](https://github.com/mobify/mobify-code-style/tree/master/css/class-naming-conventions#class-naming-conventions). The `t-` prefix indicates that the class is part of a template ([learn more on css class prefix conventions](https://github.com/mobify/mobify-code-style/tree/master/css/class-naming-conventions#class-prefix-conventions)).
The next part indicates the name of the template, which is `category`.
Finally the  `__title` part indicates a title subcomponent of the `category` template.

Another way to change the output HTML is to modify the elements that the view returns.

1. In your editor app, in the `adaptation/views` folder, open the `category.js` category view file.
2. Add a `postProcess` function to the view. Ensure that this `postProcess` first calls the `postProcess` function in the base view file.

    ```javascript
    {
        template: template,
        extend: Base, 
        postProcess: function(context) {
            context = Base.postProcess(context);

            return context;
        },

        context: {
    ```

    The `postProcess` function executes after all the elements for the view are selected, so we can grab one of those elements and make a few changes to it. The base view contains its own `postProcess` function that makes a few global changes. In order to keep these changes, call the `postProcess` for the base. More information on the `postProcess` function can be found in the [Views](https://cloud.mobify.com/docs/adaptivejs/adapting/views/#/postprocess/) guide.

3. Inside the `postProcess` function, at the top of the function, store the `context.listing` Zepto object in a `context` variable.

    ```javascript
    context = Base.postProcess(context);
    ```

4. Store the listing in a new `$listing` variable. Add the class `c-product-list` to the listing element. The `c-product-list` class name indicates that it is a self-contained component. As you apply the `c-product-list` class name to the listing element, the listing element acts as the container for the component.

    ```javascript
    var $listing = context.listing;
    
    $listing.addClass('c-product-list');
    ```

5. Add the `c-product-list__item` class to each `<li>` list item HTML tag and remove the inline styles. The `c-product-list__item` class name indicates that it is a sub-component of the `c-product-list` component. The `c-product-list__item` class name and must be a child of the `c-product-list` element.

    ```javascript
    $listing.find('li').addClass('c-product-list__item').removeAttr('style');
    ```

6. Add the `c-price` class to the `.price` div. The `c-price` class name is another self-contained component.

    ```javascript
    $listing.find('.price').addClass('c-price');
    ```

    The `c-` prefix indicates that the element is a component. In our case, we deal with two components: `c-product-list` (which has a sub-component item), and `c-price`.
    
7. Save the `category.js` file and close it.

Your newly modified view file looks like this:

##Task B

### Add SCSS Files for the Template and Components

1. In an editor app, create a new file in the `assets/styles/templates` directory. As a best practice, name the file `_category.scss` in a way that follows the [Mobify file name convention](https://github.com/mobify/mobify-code-style/tree/master/css/sass-best-practices#filename-naming-convention).
2. Add the following styles for the `t-category__title` element:

    ```scss
    // Category
    // ===

    .t-category {
    }


    // Category Title
    // ---

    .t-category__title {
        padding: 0 $h-space;
    }
    ```

    Save the `_category.scss` SCSS file and close it.

3. In the editor app, from the `/assets/styles` folder, open the `_templates.scss` file. This is where all of the template SCSS files are imported into.
4. Add the `_category.scss` file to the list of template SCSS partials.

    ```scss
    // Page Templates
    // --------------

    @import "templates/home";
    @import "templates/category";
    ```

    Save the `_templates.scss` file and close it.

5. In the editor app, in the `assets/styles/components` folder, create a new `_product-list.scss` SCSS file for the `product-list` component.
6. Add the following styles to the `_product-list.scss` product list SCSS file.

    ```scss
    // Product List
    // ===

    .c-product-list {
        @include clearfix;

        font-family: $serif;
        text-align: center;
    }


    // Product List Item
    // ---

    .c-product-list__item {
        float: left;

        display: block;
        width: 50%;
        padding: $v-space $small-h-space;

        color: $grey-20;

        &:nth-child(odd) {
            clear: both;
        }
    }
    ```
    Save the `_product-list.scss` product list file and close it.

7. In your editor app, from the `/assets/styes` folder, open the `_components.scss` component SCSS file. This is where all of the component SCSS files are imported into.
8. Add the `_product-list` SCSS file to the list of components.

    ```scss
    // Project Components
    // ------------------
    //
    // Styles for project-specific components.
    //
    // eg. @import 'components/button';

    @import 'components/card';
    @import 'components/product-list';
    ```
    Save the `_components.scss` component list file and close it.

9. Repeat Steps 5-8 in Task B. In `assets/styles/components` folder, add a `_price.scss` component file with the following styles:

    ```scss
    // Price
    // ===

    .c-price {
        color: $accent-color;
        font-family: $sans-serif;
        font-weight: bold;
    }
    ```
**Remember** to add the `_price` file to the list of compontent to the component list in `/assets/styles/_components.scss`. Save both your files in the editor when you are done.

10. View the potions category page in your browser. Refresh the page from Step 2 in Task A in this README.

    The Potions category page looks like this:

    ![Potions page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/15359/64553/sYtMKGfRqXkKOr4/Screen%20Shot%202015-01-16%20at%202.04.06%20PM.png)

11. Stop preview with the command `[control] c` on the command line in the Terminal.

##Continue to Step 4

Once the page looks good and you're ready to move on, run the following command:

```
git reset --hard HEAD && git clean -df && git checkout step-4-update-header
```

Follow the directions in the  [README](https://github.com/mobify/workshop--adaptivejs-site/blob/step-4-update-header/README.md) in the Step 4 branch.
